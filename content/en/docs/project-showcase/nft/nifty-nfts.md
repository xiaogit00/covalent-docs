# Nifty NFTs

### Website

<Aside>

"It is impressive how rich in data and well structured Covalent's API is. It seems the more we work with it, the more ideas we get."

</Aside>

&nbsp;
### Use of Covalent API
We needed to query the Ethereum blockchain for a specific contract address and filter the results with a specific owner `(auction address)` in order to obtain the NFT id that is auctioned. We used the **GET TRANSACTIONS ENDPOINT** to obtain this information: `GET /v1/{chain_id}/address/{address}/transactions_v2/`

After getting the NFT ids, in order to post about them, we needed to extract the NFT metadata. We used the **GET NFTs Meta Data**:
`GET /v1/{chain_id}/tokens/{address}/nft_metadata/{token_id}/`

All extracted data was then used in JSON format.

### Event
The project was built as part of the Covalent [Alchemist](https://www.covalenthq.com/ambassador/) Season 1.
