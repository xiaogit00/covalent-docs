# Avalanche Wallet Checker

### Website

<Aside>

“Covalent API provides the easiest way to change between blockchains with only one parameter!”

</Aside>

&nbsp;
### Use of Covalent API
We used the "Get token balances for address" endpoint to have all of the tokens of the user. After we used "Get historical portfolio value over time" to the historical price and draw a graph, we used the CoinGecko API to complete the price that Covalent doesn't return. For more coins information about transactions we used "Get ERC20 token transfers" but also parse result of "Get transactions" because the native token of the blockchain is not in the ERC20 endpoint. We used all the data as json.

### Event
