"Absolutely love the fact that the Covalent API is free to use, which opens it up to a lot of developers!"

**Simple and efficient way to keep track of your own and other wallets on the Binance Smart Chain in multiple fiat currencies other than USD and without having to connect your wallets.**

### Use of Covalent API

All Covalent data parsed in JSON format.

We call [Get token balances for address](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/{chain_id}/address/{address}/balances_v2/) periodically to get all tokens in a wallet.

We also use the endpoint [Get transactions](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/{chain_id}/address/{address}/transactions_v2/) to get transactions for a user's wallet.

As we expand on the features of our app we will be using more endpoints of the covalent API, including:
- Pulling NFT data with the [Get token balances for address](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/{chain_id}/address/{address}/balances_v2/) commonly called the `balances_v2` endpoint. 
- Managing a wallet assets using [Get historical portfolio value over time](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/{chain_id}/address/{address}/portfolio_v2/)
- Managing Profit/Loss portfolio history using [Get historical prices by addresses v2](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/pricing/historical_by_addresses_v2/{chain_id}/{quote_currency}/{contract_addresses}/)
