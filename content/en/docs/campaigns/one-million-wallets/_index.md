# One Million Wallets


![One Million Wallets Banner](/static/images/campaigns/omw-banner.png)


The purpose of *One Million Wallets* is to celebrate the creativity and diversity of blockchain developer communities. This campaign focuses on building custom-themed 'wallets' for any application. Anyone can build a crypto wallet, which we consider to be a commodity. 

The multi-week campaign consists of activities which include:
- Coding workshops
- ‘Office hours’ with guest speakers
- Conducting social media outreach
- Retail engagement challenges
- Judging wallets
- Awarding prizes

While this campaign is focused on developers interested in blockchain technologies and applications, it also includes activities for non-developers or general retail communities.

The general campaign website is: https://www.onemillionwallets.com/

## Wallet Judging Criteria
For any bounty prizes, wallet submissions are generally judged based on:

* **Originality:** Does the wallet app do something entirely novel, or at least take a fresh approach to an old problem?
* **Execution**: Is the wallet app usable in its current state? Is the user experience smooth? Does everything appear to work? Is it well designed?
* **Usefulness**: Is the wallet practical? Is it something people would actually use? Does it meet a real need?
* **Learning**: Did the individual or team stretch themselves and push the boundaries of learning in this space?
