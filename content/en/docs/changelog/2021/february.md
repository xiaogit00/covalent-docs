# February 


## 2021-02-28
### Added

- Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has been indexed and is now ready for beta testing. BSC is one of the most promising up-and-coming blockchains and we are thrilled to be supporting it. `<multichain>`

- New endpoint: [Show all NFT token IDs by contract address](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/{chainId}/tokens/{address}/nft_token_ids/) `<data-accessibility>`

- Token balances endpoint now displays the token classification (ie. ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, etc.). `<no-code>` `<data-accessibility>`

- [Topic Hash Calculator](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/tools/topic-calculator) - can find the topic hashes that are available in any smart contract address. `<no-code>` `<data-accessibility>`

- Uniswap Network V2 Assets endpoint now has an `updated_at` field to display when the last time the data was refreshed. `<data-accessibility>`
