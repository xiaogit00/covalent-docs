    <h2>
     Why Covalent
    </h2>
    <p class="text-lg">
    Simply put, Covalent's Unified API allows you to pull detailed, historical and granular blockchain data from multiple blockchains with no code. Covalent allows developers to drastically cut time, costs and complexity from blockchain application development. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-lg">
    Developers love Covalent for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc max-w-3xl">
    <li class="text-lg"><strong>Automatically indexed:</strong> All code on the underlying blockchain is automatically indexed for you, the developer. Covalent runs full archive nodes and makes an exact replica of every single contract, every wallet and every single transaction in the Covalent database. The Covalent database hosts billions of rows of data and terabytes of data.</li>
    <li class="text-lg"><strong>No-code:</strong> Covalent offers a "no-code" solution and all customizations can be done without writing a single line of code by the developer. There is no need to invest expensive engineering time in building indexing code that you'd rather invest in building your application.</li>
    <li class="text-lg"><strong>Multiple blockchains, multiple use cases:</strong> The same unified API works across 30+ blockchains and dozens of use cases like crypto-wallets, NFT galleries, investor dashboard tools, DAO tooling - the possibilities are endless.</li>
    </ul>
