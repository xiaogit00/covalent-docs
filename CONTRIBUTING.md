Contributing
------------

Please refer to the project's style and contribution guidelines for submitting patches and additions. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** to `develop` branch so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "develop" before making a pull request!
