## Appendix


### Klaytn Gas token

KLAY token is the native token of the Klaytn network. This is similar to Ether in Ethereum. To interact with the Klaytn network, KLAY tokens are required to pay as gas fees. KLAY serves as a means of payment and exchange for all applications running in the Klaytn ecosystem. Covalent's  responses automatically returns `gas_*` fields in the KLAY units.
