# API Changelog

Every change to our API matters and reflects our belief in one of the following guiding principles which we include as tags on each changelog item:

- `<multichain>` - one unified API for all chains
- `<data-accessibility>` - access to any blockchain data at any time with greater detail.
- `<no-code>` - support for non-devs

## 2021-03-30

### Added

- Integrated [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation/) chain! Fantom is a high-performance, scalable, customizable, and secure smart-contract platform. Fantom is permissionless, decentralized, and open-source while achieving fast finality (1-2 second transaction confirmation) and low fees ($0.00001). Furthermore, Fantom is EVM-compatible. `ChainID: 250`. `<multichain>`
